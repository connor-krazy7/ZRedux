#An academic research on Redux like architecture

## The project is mainly aimed to be used as a side information resource. Using it in production code without proper assignment is strongly discouraged as most of the principles could have been done simplier while trading off syntax sugar

[X] - Create macros that generate conformance to `DifferentiableProtocol`

[X] - Make it possible to use AsyncStream<*NON_SENDABLE_ACTION*> in Store as an effect

[X] - Add an ability to declare custom Effects

[ ] - Create macro for generating type erasing  wrapper `Any*`

[ ] - Create Store that combines multiple stores into a single one

[ ] - Declare some generic method in `StoreProtocol` that would allow to setup store
